## What is Type Script?

Typescript supports a set of basic types similar to JavaScript. 
Letâ€™s briefly look at each and how to declare each. 
Note how each has the variable key word, variable name, a colon, type name, 
assignment symbol and the value.
So we have: keyword Variable: Type = Value

Let's look at the basic types:
    number: Represents all kinds of numbers, including integers and floating-point numbers.
    string: Represents textual data.
    boolean: Represents true or false.
    null and undefined: Represent absence of value.
    any: Represents any type and disables type checking.
    unknown: Represents any type but is safer than any.
    void: Represents the absence of any type, commonly used in functions that do not return a value.
